# **Remote Sensing in Conservation and Wildlife Management**

The consequences of Anthropocene pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change and their effect on the flora and fauna of our planet can be difficult to pin down or study. New technologies are needed to gather data over the vast spatial and temporal regions required to show the interaction between human activity and natural processes. Remote sensing has been used to bridge this gap since the 70’s and as the technology has improved its use has become increasingly integrated into the study of species populations, their movements, and the effects of human-induced and natural change to their habitat. There are issues with knowledge gaps in those who study plants, animals, and ecology. A wildlife biologist may not have the expertise of a remote sensing expert, and efforts should be made to educate and collaborate between these natural sciences.

The future of wildlife population and ecological study are likely to include remote sensing technologies. Remote sensing is a powerful tool, study area can be tailored to the desired size by utilizing different platforms such as ground, UAV, or satellite. They can reach areas that are difficult if not impossible for humans to collect data and can now be accomplished relatively cheaply. Ecological disasters caused by humans can also benefit from the use of remote sensing. In an increasingly warm world, larger and hotter forest fires threaten habitat and the species within them. Remote sensing can be used to track and respond to these fires in real-time. This is also true of oil spills and longer-term disasters like coral bleaching (Hance 2014).

The complex relationship between mule deer and mountain lions have in part, been elucidated through the use of remote sensing (Tibbetts 2017). Scientists attached GPS collars to mule deer and tracked their movements as they populated lower elevations during winter and moved to higher elevations with the spring in their search for food. Using data collected from mountain lion movements in these same areas they were able to correlate mountain lion movements to deer movements. Interestingly, using NDVI images can be a strong predictor of where mountain lions can be found. Deer go where the plants are growing and mountain lions go where the deer are, areas with higher primary productivity will have higher deer populations and hence higher mountain lion populations.

The increase in use of remote sensing applications to study wildlife and ecology is not without its problems. An expertise in one field of study such as biology or ecology does not necessarily denote competence in another like remote sensing. Overcoming this knowledge gap will be paramount to creating good, useable data in current and future applications to this area of study. P.J. Stephenson created five questions to answer when developing a monitoring plan, including deciding if using remote sensing even makes sense for a particular project (Stephenson 2019). Those who plan to study anything using remote sensing technology should first ask themselves  if it even makes sense to do so or if the same task could be accomplished better by a different method. The lure of a shiny new toy can sometimes take precedence over practicality.

The use of remote sensing in wildlife management and ecological study will greatly improve our knowledge and understanding of these subjects and how humans influence them. If we are to mitigate the worst impacts of human behavior on the creatures we share a planet with, every available tool must be utilized. Remote sensing seems destined to play an outsized role in these fields of study. However, care should be taken when deciding which technologies are employed and for what reason. The appropriateness of the application of remote sensing to an area of study should be the first consideration rather than the desire to employ a new technology simply because it exists.
